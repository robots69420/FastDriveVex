// FastDrive includes all libraries and references for you that are needed  |
// for the robot. such as <iostream>, <string>, and "vex.h"                 |
//                                                                          |
// One of its main features is the fastDrive() function. The function takes |
// care of everything so all you need to do is type in a couple of          |
// parameters.                                                              |
